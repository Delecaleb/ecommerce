# E-commerce

## Database Setup Steps

1. Locate the SQL file: `testcommerce.sql` in the root directory
2. Import it into your MySQL database

## User Categories

There are two user categories:

1. User
2. Admin

Both use the same login and registration page.  
To create an admin account, check the "Create as admin" checkbox. This is because the project is meant to be a basic web app.

## Login Credentials

### Regular User

-   Email: `user1@gmail.com`
-   Password: `password`

### Admin

-   Email:`admin@mail.com`
-   Password: `password`
